# BellTab — Build Log

The running record of what we built, what we decided and why, what broke, and
what we still owe. Updated **every time something changes** — not summarized at
the end of a phase.

- **Scope** lives in `Docs/belltab-plan.md`. **Phases** live in `Docs/roadmap.md`.
  This file is the narrative between them.
- **All timestamps are local time, `America/New_York`** (UTC−4 as of this
  writing). Absolute dates only — never "yesterday".
- **Append, don't rewrite.** When a decision is reversed, add a new entry that
  supersedes the old one and mark the old one. The wrong turns are the part
  worth keeping.

## How to update this file

1. Add a dated entry under **Session log** describing what changed.
2. If a *why* was involved, add a row to **Decisions**.
3. If something is broken, unfinished, or knowingly wrong, add it to **Open
   gaps** — and move it to **Closed** when fixed, with the date.

## Current state

**Working:** a plain HTML/CSS/JS countdown, no build step. The clock ticks, the
tab title updates, all five schedule phases render.

**Not started:** the schedule list view, the editor, sharing, and the entire
Next.js/TypeScript port.

### Files

| File | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `src/index.html` | Markup only. Ten `id` attributes are the sockets JS writes into. |
| `src/styles.css` | Design tokens (palette → semantic layer), light + dark, all layout. |
| `src/schedule.js` | Hard-coded schedule data. No logic. |
| `src/app.js` | Pure engine (top half) + DOM and clock (bottom half). |

### Running it

```bash
npx serve src --listen 3000
# → http://localhost:3000
```

A server is **required** — `src/app.js` uses ES modules, and browsers refuse to
load modules over `file://` because there is no content type without HTTP.

## Decisions

| Date | Decision | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2026-08-26 | Build in plain HTML/CSS/JS first, port to Next.js + TypeScript after | Deliberate detour from roadmap Phase 0. Goal is to see the wiring before a framework hides it. The engine is framework-free by design, so the port is mechanical. |
| 2026-08-26 | `src/` from the first file, even without a build step | Matches `AGENTS.md`. Moving later is pure churn. |
| 2026-08-26 | ES modules + a local server, not `<script>` globals over `file://` | Globals would work with zero setup but teach a pattern we would throw away at the port. |
| 2026-08-26 | Installed Node 24.19.0 / npm 11.17.0 via winget | Machine had neither Node nor a real Python (`python.exe` on PATH was the Microsoft Store stub). Node is required by Phase 0 anyway — Next, Vitest, Playwright, markdownlint. |
| 2026-08-26 | Times stored as minutes-since-midnight integers | Repo invariant. A bell schedule is wall-clock, so integers are DST-safe and comparable. `Date` is read in exactly one place, `app.js:193`. |
| 2026-08-26 | `hm(9, 5)` helper in `schedule.js` instead of literal `545` | Runs once at load, produces the same integer, and eleven hand-written minute counts is how you get a typo nobody notices for weeks. |
| 2026-08-26 | Periods are half-open intervals `[start, end)` | With `<=` on both ends, back-to-back periods both claim the boundary second and the display flickers between them once a second. |
| 2026-08-26 | CSS uses two token layers: raw palette, then semantic names | Dark mode becomes ~10 lines of re-pointing instead of hunting hex codes through 40 rules. |
| 2026-08-26 | Countdown number uses `--fg`, **not** butterscotch | **Deviates from `Docs/design/design-system.md`.** See Deviations below. |
| 2026-08-26 | Dark mode declared twice — media query *and* `[data-theme]` | `:root:not([data-theme="light"])` inside the media query lets a future toggle override the OS in both directions. |
| 2026-08-26 | Tab title uses `Math.ceil` on remaining minutes | `floor` shows `0m` for the last 59 seconds of a period, which reads as "it is over" when it is not. |
| 2026-08-26 | Every DOM write is `textContent`; `innerHTML` banned in this codebase | Period names will arrive from share links, i.e. from strangers. `innerHTML` here is an XSS hole triggered by sending someone a URL. |
| 2026-08-26 | Pure engine kept inside `app.js` for now, clearly sectioned | Readable in one sitting while learning. The friction of testing it (see 11:15 entry) is the signal for when to extract. |
| 2026-08-26 | This log is maintained per-change, and the rule lives in `AGENTS.md` | A convention that exists only in conversation dies with the session. Encoded as a checked-in rule so it survives context loss and applies to anyone working the repo. |

## Deviations from the plan docs

Recorded so they get folded back in rather than quietly diverging.

### Countdown color vs. the design system

`Docs/design/design-system.md` §5 specifies the remaining-time number as
butterscotch. On the light `--paper` background that measures roughly **1.9:1**
contrast, and `--butterscotch-dark` only reaches about **2.9:1** — both below the
**3:1** floor the same document sets for large text in §6, which explicitly
flags butterscotch-on-paper as "the pair most likely to fail quietly".

**What we shipped:** the number uses `--fg` (ink in light, cream in dark), and
butterscotch is spent on the progress fill instead. This also matches the
supplied mockups, where the number is near-white.

**Owed:** either amend the design system, or find a darker accent that clears
3:1 and keeps the biscuit character.

### Roadmap phase order

We are building a plain-JS spike of **Phase 2 (the countdown)** before
**Phase 0 (the Next.js scaffold)**. Phase 0 is not cancelled — it is deferred
until the plain version has taught us the shape.

## Open gaps

| Opened | Item | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2026-08-26 | `splitCountdown` is ambiguous over an hour | Under 60 min it renders `43:12` (min:sec); over, it flips to `3:38` (hr:min). Identical shape, different units. Needs a unit label, which needs a slot in the markup. Flagged in-code as `KNOWN GAP`. |
| 2026-08-26 | Fonts are not real | Fredoka / Manrope / Space Mono are named in the CSS stack but nothing loads them — "no network at runtime" rules out Google Fonts. Self-host at the Next port via `next/font`. Currently rendering system fallbacks. |
| 2026-08-26 | Edit button is a `⚙` character, not an icon | Labeled and functional, but renders differently per platform. Replace with inline SVG. |
| 2026-08-26 | Pure engine not extracted; no test runner | Verified by hand-copying functions into a scratch file. Needs `src/engine.js` + Vitest. |
| 2026-08-26 | 12-hour clock has no am/pm | Matches the mockups and is unambiguous for a school day. Revisit if a schedule ever crosses noon ambiguously. |
| 2026-08-26 | No `clearInterval` anywhere | Harmless for a page that lives until closed. Becomes a timer leak on every remount once this is a React component — needs a `useEffect` cleanup at the port. |
| 2026-08-26 | `els` is a one-time DOM snapshot | If the DOM is ever rebuilt (the editor will do this), those cached references point at detached nodes and paints silently go nowhere. |
| 2026-08-26 | Schedule list view not built | Mockup 1. Day progress bar, per-period rows, current-period highlight. |
| 2026-08-26 | `Docs/roadmap.md` status line is stale | It says "The repo has no commits and no remote yet." Both are now false — `origin` is `github.com/zfert99/belltab.git` and `main` has a commit. Left for the user to reword, since the same block carries the open questions about repo name and the `/bell` path. |
| 2026-08-26 | `src/belltab.code-workspace` is ignored, not committed | Editor-personal file, and `src/` is the wrong home for it either way. `.gitignore` carries `*.code-workspace`; reverse that line if the workspace config is meant to be shared. |

## Bugs found

### 2026-08-26 — three "engine failures" that were bad test expectations

The first run of the boundary checks reported 3 of 18 failing. All three were
wrong assertions, not wrong code:

- Two expected `98%` progress one second before a bell; the real answer is
  `3299/3300 = 99.97%`, which rounds to `100`. Arithmetic error in the test.
- One expected 10:22 to fall in Period 2. In our schedule, 10:22 is inside
  Period 3 — and by coincidence with exactly 43 minutes left, which is what made
  the mistake look plausible against the mockup.

**Lesson:** a failing assertion is a claim that two things disagree, not proof
that the code is the wrong one. Both were resolved by computing the expected
value by hand rather than by editing the engine until it agreed.

### 2026-08-26 — the supplied mockups are internally inconsistent

Mockup 2 shows `43:12` remaining in "Period 2" while mockup 1 lists Period 2 as
9:05–10:05 and the wall clock as 10:22. Those cannot both be true. Treated the
art as a visual reference, not a specification.

## Session log

### 2026-08-26 09:27 — `src/index.html`

Markup only, no styling, no logic. Four regions: header bar, countdown block,
progress bar, bounds footer. Ten `id` attributes as JS sockets; classes reserved
for CSS. All time fields start as `--:--` placeholders so a broken script shows
obviously-empty rather than a confidently wrong clock. No `aria-live` on the
countdown — a per-second live region would flood a screen reader. Progress bar
is a plain `<div aria-hidden="true">`, not `<progress>`, since the same numbers
are stated as text around it.

### 2026-08-26 09:29 — `src/styles.css`

Biscuit Lab tokens copied verbatim, then a semantic layer on top. Light and dark
both ship. Added `bounds__edge--start` / `--end` classes to the HTML so the
footer can re-flow via `grid-template-areas` below 30rem. `tabular-nums` on every
clock value — without it the countdown physically twitches once a second as digit
widths change. `prefers-reduced-motion` collapses all transitions.

### 2026-08-26 09:33 — `src/schedule.js`

Hard-coded "Regular day": eleven periods, 8:00 to 14:30, explicit `Passing`
periods filling the mid-day gaps. Data only — no logic, no clock, no DOM. The
day deliberately does **not** tile: before 8:00 and after 14:30 belong to no
period, because those are real states the UI must render.

### 2026-08-26 ~10:30 — toolchain

No Node, no real Python on the machine. Installed Node.js LTS 24.19.0 via
`winget`. Started `npx serve src` on port 3000. Confirmed `schedule.js` serves as
`application/javascript` — the content type is precisely why `file://` cannot
work for modules.

### 2026-08-26 09:39 — `src/app.js`

The clock. Split into a pure half (`stateAt`, `formatClock`, `splitCountdown`,
`formatTabTitle`) and an impure half (`els`, `paint`, `tick`).

**The load-bearing rule:** `tick()` recomputes everything from `new Date()` every
time. No variable holds a remaining-time value that gets decremented. Hidden tabs
are throttled to roughly one wakeup per minute and frozen outright on mobile, so
a decrementing counter loses exactly as much time as the tab spent asleep and
never notices. `setInterval` being unreliable is *expected and harmless* here by
construction.

One `setInterval` in the whole app; `visibilitychange` and `focus` also call
`tick` so the number is already correct on return rather than up to a second
stale.

### 2026-08-26 ~11:15 — engine verification

Copied the pure half into a scratch file and ran 18 boundary checks under Node:
exact first bell, last second of a period, exact handoff between back-to-back
periods, last second of the day, exact last bell, midnight both sides, a real gap
in a non-tiling schedule, empty schedule, single-period schedule, and the
`formatClock` cases. All pass.

**This is the extraction signal.** The checks needed a hand-copied duplicate
because importing `app.js` under Node crashes on `document`. That friction is the
codebase saying where the file wants to split.

### 2026-08-26 11:38 — this document

Started the build log. Backfilled every entry above from file timestamps, the
session transcript, and `git log`.

### 2026-08-26 11:39 — markdown lint cleanup

`npx markdownlint-cli "**/*.md"` reported nine pre-existing errors, all in
`Docs/research/background-timers-and-schedule-modeling.md` — eight
MD032 (a bolded lead-in paragraph butted directly against the list below it) and
one MD047 (no trailing newline). Purely mechanical, no prose changed. Repo now
lints clean, which is the state `AGENTS.md` requires before concluding any
change.

### 2026-08-26 11:40 — `AGENTS.md` gains a build-log section

Promoted the "update the log with every change" convention from a conversational
agreement to a checked-in rule, as a new **The Build Log** section between
*Documentation Standards* and *Roadblock & Research Rules*. Spells out the four
things every change adds (session entry, decision row, open gap, bug entry) and
the three rules for the file itself (append don't rewrite, absolute local
timestamps, record deviations explicitly).

The point: a convention that lives only in a conversation dies when the
conversation does.

### 2026-08-26 11:42 — first feature commit

Added a `.gitignore` — the repo had none. Covers `node_modules/`, `.env*` (with
`.env.example` un-ignored per `AGENTS.md`), the Next build output that arrives at
Phase 0, Playwright and coverage artifacts, `.vercel`, and OS/editor cruft.

Work went onto `feat/countdown-plain-js` rather than straight onto `main`, per
the GitHub Flow rule. Two commits: the `src/` spike, then the documentation.

Discovered while checking git state: **`origin` already exists** and points at
`github.com/zfert99/belltab.git`. `Docs/roadmap.md` still claims the repo has no
commits and no remote. Logged as an open gap rather than silently edited — that
same status block carries the open questions about the repo name and whether the
path stays `/bell`, which are the user's calls.
